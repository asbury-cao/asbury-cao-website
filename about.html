        I was born in the Philippines but grew up in the U.S. with two siblings, an older sister and younger brother. I have a loving girlfriend who I met in college and has been a huge support throughout all my career changes. I got my music skills from my parents who are amazing singers and taught me to play guitar and trumpet. And I can't forget our Dachshund terrier who just turned 5 years old. I grew up playing basketball and always leave a spare one in my trunk in case of spontaneous hoop sessions with the boys. I love cycling and have a few century marathons under my belt, hence the song choice below.
        It's hard to talk about myself so I think I'll leave it there.&#128513;
