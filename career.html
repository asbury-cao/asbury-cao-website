        I'm a UC Merced grad with a B.S. in Mech Eng who's worked in several  disciplines over the past few years. I started as an HVAC systems designer working towards a P.E. license at Siemens Building Technologies. I then joined an engineering lab called PCTEST that specialized in EMC/RF testing. Both industries had different work cultures and career growth opportunities but I still could not picture myself working in either long term.<br><br>

        So that brings me to Rithm. An old co-worker of mine from Siemens graduated from the program back in 2020 and convinced me to look into programming as a potential career. I began learning Javascript/HTML/CSS in my spare time and after a few months of practice that sparked my interest I decided to apply and pursue a career in web development.<br><br>
